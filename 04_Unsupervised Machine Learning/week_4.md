# WEEK 4 QUIZ

## Q1. Select the option that best completes the following sentence: For data with many features, principal components analysis
`generates new features that are linear combinations of the original features.`

## Q2. Which option correctly lists the steps for implementing PCA in Python?

1. Fit PCA to data

2. Scale the data

3. Determine the desired number of components based on total explained variance

4. Define a PCA object

`2, 4, 1, 3 `

## Q3. Given the following matrix for lengths of singular vectors, how do we rank the vectors in terms of importance?
<pre>
  [11 0 0 0 
   0 3 0 0
   0 0 2 0
   0 0 0 1]
</pre>
 `v1, v2, v3, v4 `

## Q4. Given two principal components v1, v2, let's say that feature f1 contributed 0.15 to v1 and 0.25 to v2. Feature f2 contributed -0.11 to v1 and 0.4 to v2. Which feature is more important according to their total contribution to the components?
`v2 because |-0.11| + |0.4| > |0.15| + |0.25|`


## Q5. (True/False) In PCA,  the first principal component represents the most important feature in the dataset.
`False`
