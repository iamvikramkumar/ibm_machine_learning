# WEEK 3 QUIZ

## Q1. When using DBSCAN, how does the algorithm determine that a cluster is complete and is time to move to a different point of the data set and potentially start a new cluster?
`When no point is left unvisited by the chain reaction.` 

## Q2. Which of the following statements correctly defines the strengths of the DBSCAN algorithm?

`No need to specify the number of clusters (cf. K-means), allows for noise, and can handle arbitrary-shaped clusters.`

## Q3. Which of the following statements correctly defines the weaknesses of the DBSCAN algorithm?

`It needs two parameters as input, finding appropriate values of ∆ê and n_clu can be difficult, and it does not do well with clusters of different density.`

## Q4. (True/false) Does complete linkage refers to the maximum pairwise distance between clusters?

`True`

## Q5. Which of the following measure methods computes the inertia and pick the pair that is going to ultimately minimize the inertia value?
`Ward linkage`
