# WEEK 1 QUIZ
## Q1. What is the goal of supervised learning?
Predict the labels.

## Q2. What is deep learning? 

Deep learning is machine learning that involves deep neural networks.

## Q3. When is a standard machine learning algorithm usually a better choice than using deep learning to get the job done?
When working with small data sets.

## Q4. What is a Turing test?

It tests a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior. 

## Q5. What are some of the different milestones in deep learning history?
Geoffrey Hintonâ€™s work, AlexNet, and TensorFlow

Correct
In 2006, the previous limitations of deep learning, namely exploding and vanishing gradients were overcome with algorithmic advancements such as Geoffrey Hinton's work on unsupervised pre-training. Neural networks are rebranded as deep learning, as we are able to train much deeper networks, networks with more layers; In 2012, a deep learning model using convolutional neural nets called AlexNet achieved a top five error of 15.3 percent; In 2015, one of the most popular libraries, TensorFlow, was built for deep learning, making it more powerful and accessible. 

## Q6. What is artificial intelligence?
Any program that can sense, reason, act, and adapt.


## Q7. What are two spaces within AI that are going through drastic growth and innovation?
Computer vision and natural language processing.

## Q8. Why did AI flourish so much in the last years?
Faster and inexpensive computers and data storage

## Q9. How does Alexa use artificial intelligence?

Recognizes our voice and answers questions.

## Q10. What are the first two steps of a typical machine learning workflow?
Problem statement and data collection.
