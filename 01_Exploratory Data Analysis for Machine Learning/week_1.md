Question 2
What is deep learning? 

1 / 1 point

Deep learning is machine learning that involves deep neural networks.


Deep learning is another name for artificial intelligence.


Deep learning includes artificial intelligence and machine learning. 


None of the above are correct.

Correct
Deep learning is machine learning that involves using very complicated models called deep neural networks. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. 

3.
Question 3
When is a standard machine learning algorithm usually a better choice than using deep learning to get the job done?

1 / 1 point

When working with small data sets.


When the data is steady over time.


When working with large data sets. 


None of the above are correct.

Correct
A standard machine learning algorithm is a better choice when you are working with smaller datasets, and if the data is changing a lot over time and you don't have a steady dataset.

4.
Question 4
What is a Turing test?

1 / 1 point

It tests a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior. 


It tests the dataset.


It tests and cleans the dataset. 


It tests images.

Correct
In 1950, Alan Turing developed the Turing test to test a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior. Alan Turing's test has served as a foundational threshold for artificial intelligence.

Question 5
What are some of the different milestones in deep learning history?

1 / 1 point

Deep Blue defeats a world champion chess player and TensorFlow is released


Deep Blue defeats a world champion chess player, and AlexNet is created.


Geoffrey Hintonâ€™s work, AlexNet, and TensorFlow


Deep Blue defeats a world champion chess player, and Keras is released.

Correct
In 2006, the previous limitations of deep learning, namely exploding and vanishing gradients were overcome with algorithmic advancements such as Geoffrey Hinton's work on unsupervised pre-training. Neural networks are rebranded as deep learning, as we are able to train much deeper networks, networks with more layers; In 2012, a deep learning model using convolutional neural nets called AlexNet achieved a top five error of 15.3 percent; In 2015, one of the most popular libraries, TensorFlow, was built for deep learning, making it more powerful and accessible.

Question 6
What is artificial intelligence?

1 / 1 point

A subset of deep learning.


Any program that can sense, reason, act, and adapt.


A subset of machine learning


None of the above. 

Correct
Artificial intelligence is any program that can sense, reason, act, and adapt. It is essentially a machine taking any form of intelligent behavior.

7.
Question 7
What are two spaces within AI that are going through drastic growth and innovation?

1 / 1 point

Computer vision and natural language processing.


Language processing and deep learning.


Deep learning and machine learning. 


Computer vision and deep learning.

Correct
In two spaces we are seeing drastic growth and innovation, computer vision and natural language processing. The sharp advancements in computer vision are impacting multiple areas. For example, cars getting to the point where they can drive themselves. Similarly, natural language processing is booming with vast improvements in ability to translate, determine sentiment, clustering of new articles, writing papers, and many others.

8.
Question 8
Why did AI flourish so much in the last years?

1 / 1 point

Access to hardware for cleaning data 


Faster and inexpensive computers and data storage


Data storage in the cloud is much more expensive


Stylish designed computers

Correct
AI flourished in the last years with the cloud infrastructure now in place to store large amounts of data for much cheaper, and the plethora of new ways to capture data are now able to build larger, more new once datasets to learn underlying patterns across a multitude of fields. We also have faster computers, and we now have access to powerful hardware for processing and storing data.
