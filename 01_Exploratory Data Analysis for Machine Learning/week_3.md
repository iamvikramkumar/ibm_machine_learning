# WEEK 3 QUIZ
## Q1. Which scaling approach converts features to standard normal variables?
Standard scaling

## Q2. Which variable transformation should you use for ordinal data?

Ordinal encoding

## Q3. What are polynomial features?

They are higher order relationships in the data.

## Q4. What does Boxcox transformation do?
It transforms the data distribution into more symmetrical bell curve

## Q5. Select three important reasons why EDA is useful.
To determine if the data makes sense, to determine whether further data cleaning is needed, and to help identify patterns and trends in the data

## Q6. What assumption does the linear regression model make about data?
This model assumes a linear relationship between predictor variables and outcome variables.

## Q7. What is skewed data?

Data that is distorted away from normal distribution; may be positively or negatively skewed.

## Q8. Select the two primary types of categorical feature encoding.

One-hot encoding and ordinal encoding 

## Q9. Which scaling approach puts values between zero and one?

Min-max scaling

Correct
Correct. Min-max scaling converts variables to continuous variables in the (0, 1) interval by mapping minimum values to 0 and maximum values to 1.

## Q10. Which variable transformation should you use for nominal data with multiple different values within the feature?
One-hot encoding
