# WEEK 3 QUIZ
Which scaling approach converts features to standard normal variables?

1 / 1 point

Standard scaling


MinMax scaling


Robust scaling


Nearest neighbor scaling

Correct
Correct. Standard scaling converts variables to standard normal variables.

2.
Question 2
Which variable transformation should you use for ordinal data?

1 / 1 point

One-hot encoding


Min-max scaling


Standard scaling


Ordinal encoding

Correct
Correct. Use ordinal encoding if there is some order to the categorical features.

3.
Question 3
What are polynomial features?

1 / 1 point

They are logistic regression coefficients.


They are represented by linear relationships in the data.


They are higher order relationships in the data.


They are lower order relationships in the data.

Correct
Correct. Polynomial features are estimated by higher order polynomials in a linear model, like squared, cubed, etc.

4.
Question 4
What does Boxcox transformation do?

1 / 1 point

It transforms categorical variables into numerical variables.


It makes the data more right skewed.


It makes the data more left skewed


It transforms the data distribution into more symmetrical bell curve

Correct
Correct. Boxcox is one of the ways we can transform our skewed dataset to be more normally distributed.

5.
Question 5
Select three important reasons why EDA is useful.

0 / 1 point

To analyze data sets, to determine the main characteristics of data sets, and to use sampling to examine data


To determine if the data makes sense, to determine whether further data cleaning is needed, and to help identify patterns and trends in the data


To utilize summary statistics, to create visualizations, and to identify outliers


To examine correlations, to sample from dataframes, and to train models on random samples of data

Incorrect
Review the Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) video.

6.
Question 6
What assumption does the linear regression model make about data?

1 / 1 point

This model assumes that raw data in data sets is on the same scale.


This model assumes an addition of each one of the model parameters multiplied by a coefficient.


This model assumes a linear relationship between predictor variables and outcome variables.


This model assumes a transformation of each parameter to a linear relationship.

Correct
Correct. The linear regression model assumes a linear relationship between predictor and outcome variables.

7.
Question 7
What is skewed data?

1 / 1 point

Data that is distorted away from normal distribution; may be positively or negatively skewed.


Data that has a normal distribution.


Raw data that has undergone log transformation.


Raw data that may not have a linear relationship.

Correct
Correct. Often raw data, both the features and the outcome variable, can be negatively or positively skewed. 

8.
Question 8
Select the two primary types of categorical feature encoding.

0 / 1 point

One-hot encoding and ordinal encoding 


Nominal encoding and ordinal encoding


Encoding and scaling


Log and polynomial transformation

Incorrect
Review the Feature Encoding video.

9.
Question 9
Which scaling approach puts values between zero and one?

1 / 1 point

Min-max scaling


Nearest neighbor scaling


Robust scaling


Standard scaling

Correct
Correct. Min-max scaling converts variables to continuous variables in the (0, 1) interval by mapping minimum values to 0 and maximum values to 1.

10.
Question 10
Which variable transformation should you use for nominal data with multiple different values within the feature?

1 / 1 point

Min-max scaling


One-hot encoding


Standard scaling


Ordinal encoding

Correct
Correct. Use one-hot encoding if there are multiple different values within a feature.
