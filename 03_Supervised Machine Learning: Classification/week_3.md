## Q1. Select the TRUE statement regarding the cost function for SVMs:
- [ ] SVMs do not use a cost function. They use regularization instead of a cost function.

Q2. Which statement about Support Vector Machines is TRUE?

- [ ] Support Vector Machine models are non-linear. 
- [x] Support Vector Machine models rarely overfit on training data.
- [ ] Support Vector Machine models can be used for regression but not for classification. 
- [ ] Support Vector Machine models can be used for classification but not for regression. 


## Q3. (True/False) A large c term will penalize the SVM coefficients more heavily.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

## Q4. Regularization in the context of support vector machine (SVM) learning is meant to _________________.

- [x] lessen the impact that some minor misclassifications have on the cost function
- [ ] encourage the model to ignore outliers during training
- [ ] bring all features to a common scale to ensure they have equal weight

## Q5. Support vector machines can be extended to work with nonlinear classification boundaries by ___________________.

- [ ] modifying the standard sigmoid function
- [x] using the kernel trick
- [ ] projecting the feature space onto a lower dimensional space
- [ ] incorporating polynomial regression
