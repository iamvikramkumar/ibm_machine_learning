## Q1. The main purpose of splitting your data into a training and test sets is:
   - To avoid overfitting

## Q2. Complete the following sentence: The training data is used to fit the model, while the test data is used to:
   - Measure error and performance of the model

## Q3. What term is used if your test data leaks into the training data?
   - Data leakage

## Q4. Which one of the below terms uses a linear combination of features?
   - Linear Regression

## Q5. When splitting your data, what is the purpose of the training data?
   - Fit the actual model and learn the parameters

## Q6. Polynomial features capture what effects?
   - Non-linear effects.

## Q7. Which fundamental problems are being solved by adding non-linear patterns, such as polynomial features, to a standard linear approach?
   - Prediction and Interpretation.

## Q8. A testing data could be also referred to as:
   - Unseen data

## Q9. Select the correct syntax to obtain the data split that will result in a train set that is 60% of the size of your available data:
   - X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.4)

## Q10. What is the correct sklearn syntax to add a third-degree polynomial to your model?
    - polyFeat = PolynomialFeatures(degree=3)
