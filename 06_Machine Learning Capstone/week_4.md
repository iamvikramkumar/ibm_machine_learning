# WEEK 4 QUIZ


## Q1. Which of the following methods can be used to convert a dense matrix saved as a long/vertical format to a sparse matrix?
`pivot()`  
The pivot() method can be used to convert a dense matrix to a sparse matrix.

## Q2. Which of the following methods from the KNNBasic class can be used to train a KNN-based collaborative filtering model with a training set?

`fit()`


## Q3. Which of the following is a Python scikit library used for recommender systems? 

`Surprise`

## Q4. Say you are given a sparse user-item interaction matrix, A, with dimensions 10000 x 500 and you defined the latent feature vector dimension to be 37. If non-negative matrix factorization is applied to A to decompose it into a user matrix, U, and an item matrix, I, what are the dimensions of U and I? 

`U (10000 x 37) and I (37 x 500)`

## Q5. If the pre-defined RecommenderNet is provided a user one-hot vector and an item one-hot vector as inputs, what is the expected output?
`A rating estimation`

## Q6. In the Neural Networks lab, what is meant by embedding?

`Embedding the one-hot encoding vector into a latent feature space`

## Q7. In the Regression lab, what is the data that is input into the regression model?

`An interaction feature vector`

## Q8. Which of the following method(s) can be used to aggregate two feature vectors?

- [ ] Element-wise addition
- [ ] Element-wise multiplication
- [ ] Element-wise max/min
- [x] All of the above

## Q9. In the Classification lab, which values are used as input to LabelEncoder()?
`Rating mode`

## Q10. What does the fit_transform() method in the LabelEnocder class return?
`Encoded labels`
